# CS353-Database-Systems-Project
Online Technical Interview Preparation and Coding Platform

We are designing a system where users prepare for technical job interviews. There are users,
editors and companies. Editors prepares both coding challenges, coding contests and non-coding
questions. Users will try to solve challenges and answer questions. Companies also should be
able to prepare a series of coding challenges and non-coding questions as a part of their interview
process. Both challenges and questions should have categories such as dynamic programming
and system design respectively.

This project is being developed for CS353 - Database Systems course at Bilkent University.
